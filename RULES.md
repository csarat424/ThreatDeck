## Play Modes

### Standard Mode
Survive until the end.

### Hard Mode
Continue playing Attack cards until only one player, or none, remain. If there are two players remaining in the last round, and the first player is eliminated by the next wave of Attack cards, the second player must still receive their Attack cards. If they can defend their Assets, they win; if they cannot, the dealer wins.

### Players: 2-5
Note that you will need 1 x Dealer (one of the players can take on this role if you don’t have an extra player).

## Game Prep
 - Each player needs an individual ThreatDeck to play. IE: If there are 5 players, you need 5x ThreatDeck.
 - Each player selects one set of 5x Asset cards and a complete set of 12 x Defence cards. Set aside the rest of the Asset cards. They will not be used.
 - Shuffle Attack and Chance cards together and place in one deck.
 - Dealer controls Attack and Chance cards but must play blind with deck facedown.
 - Each round deals first to the next player in a clockwise fashion (like shifting blinds in Poker). If Player One receives the first attack in Round One, Player Two will receive the first attack in Round Two while Player One receives the last attack in Round Two.


 ## Rules
 - In each round, all players will play an Asset card from their set (Corporate Assets are always played in Round One).
 - Dealer will then play one Attack card (except in Round Three and Five).
 - All Attacks played by Dealer must match the Player’s Asset categories (Corporate, Web, IoT, Business Applications and Cloud). If they do not, keep dealing until appropriate card is drawn.
 - If the Player has the right Defence cards, they win. If they do not, the Dealer wins and the Player receives one Strike.
 - Receive three Strikes and you lose.
 - Repeat play for fve rounds until one Player remains, or all are eliminated.
 - Round Three: Double Attack: Players repeat normal steps, but the Dealer will attack each player twice, instead of once.
 - Round Five: Final: Players repeat normal steps, but the Dealer will attack each player three times, instead of once. Whoever remains, wins.
